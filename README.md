```
/MobileTrackingSystem
  |- /screenshots           # Optional: Place your screenshots here
      |- 1.png              # Screenshot of the application interface
  |- MobileTrackingSystem.java   # Your main Java file
  |- README.md                      # Project description
  |- .gitignore                     # To exclude unnecessary files (optional)
```

### Steps to Upload to GitHub

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select **New Repository**.
   - Enter a repository name (e.g., `MobileTrackingSystem`).
   - Optionally, add a description and select the visibility (Public/Private).
   - Click **Create Repository**.

2. **Initialize Your Local Repository**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/MobileTrackingSystem
   ```

   Initialize Git in the project folder:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Add and Commit Files**:
   Add all files to the staging area:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit of Mobile Tracking System"
   ```

4. **Link to the GitHub Repository**:
   Copy the repository's remote URL from GitHub (it will look like `https://github.com/username/repository.git`).

   Add the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/MobileTrackingSystem.git
   ```

5. **Push to GitHub**:
   Push the code to the repository:
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Additional Tips

- **.gitignore**:
  Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `.class` files or IDE-specific files like `.idea/` for IntelliJ or `*.iml`):
  ```plaintext
  # Ignore class files
  *.class

  # Ignore IntelliJ IDEA project files
  .idea/
  *.iml
  ```

- **Screenshots**:
  If you're including screenshots, ensure they are in a `screenshots` folder and referenced correctly in the `README.md`.

- **Verify**:
  Go to your repository on GitHub and confirm that all files are uploaded properly, including `MobileTrackingSystem.java`, `README.md`, and any screenshots.

Once uploaded, share the repository link with others or use it as part of your portfolio!

### README.md Content:

```markdown
# Mobile Tracking System

This is a simple mobile tracking system built using Java and Swing. The application allows users to enter latitude and longitude coordinates and simulate the tracking of a location.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI with input fields for latitude and longitude.
- Simulates location tracking when the "Track" button is clicked.
- Displays the entered latitude and longitude along with a simulated tracking message.
- Provides basic validation to ensure both latitude and longitude are entered before tracking.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher.
- Swing library (bundled with Java, no additional installation required).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mobile-tracking-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mobile-tracking-system
   ```

3. Compile and run the program:

   ```bash
   javac MobileTrackingSystem.java
   java MobileTrackingSystem
   ```

## Usage

- Launch the application, and the user interface will prompt you to input latitude and longitude values.
- After entering the coordinates, click on the "Track" button.
- The application will display the entered coordinates and simulate a location tracking process.

### Example Output:

```
Tracking location...
Latitude: 40.7128
Longitude: -74.0060
Location tracked successfully!
```

## Screenshot

Here's a screenshot of the application interface:
